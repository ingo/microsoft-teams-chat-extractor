#Microsoft Teams Chat Extractor
 A Chrome extension to extract chats from Microsoft Teams Web

Microsoft teams does not currently support easily copying transcripts from the interface. This is a much requested feature, as evidenced by https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/32184895-export-your-conversations-to-a-document (3500 votes, 22 pages of comments)

This is not a perfect solution, but it works pretty well.

1. Download the source code for this extension to your computer (user the Code > Download .zip menu option)
2. Install the extension into Chrome (see https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually/)
3. Log into Microsoft Teams on the web (https://teams.microsoft.com)
4. Go to the chat you wish to extract. Note that it only will extract the content that's loaded, so if you want a longer history, scroll upwards in your chat history until you've loaded all the content you like
5. Press the little purple chat button. A popup will appear with the content included
6. Copy and paste into whatever form you like.
